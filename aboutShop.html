            <h1>More About Us!</h1>
            <p>We were founded in 1445 by Ívar Úddason. Ívar Úddason had grown up on a wheat farm with his mother, father, 3 sisters and 2 brothers. Growing up in a poor 
                town Ívar wanted to change his and his family's life to a better living situation. He left home at the age of 14 and started his adventure to a better future. 
                He journeyed across the country, meeting many parculiar characters. On his journey he discovered that many adventures have a difficult time finding a 
                reliable shop to buy their nessecities from. Ívar came up with an idea that would solve the problems of his family while helping others along the way! 
                That's how the shop, Jovial Junk came to be. Jovial Junk has been passed down the Úddason family for many generations, always providing the best quality 
                products at a reasonable price!
